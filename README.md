# Customer Segmentation using Clustering

In this project, I analyzed customer data from a grocery store to group customers into different categories based on their similarities. This process, called **customer segmentation**, helps businesses better understand and serve various customer types. By identifying distinct groups, the business can tailor its products and services to meet the unique needs and preferences of each group, improving customer satisfaction and focusing on the most valuable customers.

Please check out the detailed report and findings in my [Notebook](./Notebook_Customer%20segmentation%20by%20Anand.ipynb) for more insights.

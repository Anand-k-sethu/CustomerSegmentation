# Customer Segmentation using clustring


In this project, I analyzed customer data from a grocery store to group customers into different categories based on their similarities. This process, called customer segmentation, helps to better understand and serve different types of customers. By identifying distinct groups, the business can tailor its products and services to meet the unique needs and preferences of each group, improving customer satisfaction and focusing on the most valuable customers

 Please check out the  [Notebook_Customer Segmentation by Anand.ipynb](./notebooks/Notebook_Customer%20Segmentation%20by%20Anand.ipynb) for a detailed report and findings. 

Thanks
